    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>
      Since the current health conditions and the status of the Internet that doesn't
      allow us do a discussion over a video connection, I created this file
      to explain a little bit this project (sorry about the
      language mistakes :v)
    </p>
    <p>
      I know very well that the browser isn't the best place for this type of
      projects that needs a high performance , speed... and obviously browser
      isn't the right place , but i like web development and i try to build
      every project on form of a web app to learn more and get more experience
      in this field.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to that , i want to publish this project on my
      protfolio so i spent more time on it , I added some things , i worked more on
      interface and design ...
    </p>
    <p>I would like to notice that every line of code in this project all algorithms and design i personally wrote it
      from scratch.</p>
    <h3>Languages Used:</h3>
    <p>
      HTML , CSS , vanilla javascript (vanilla JavaScript means No libraries
      No frameworks Nothing Just the programming language itself.)
    </p>


    <h3>How to use</h3>
    <p>
      please open the index.html file with your browser , updated mozilla
      firefox or google chrome (recommended)
    </p>
    <h3>interface :</h3>
    <p>
      when you open the index.html file the interface should looks like this :
    </p>
    <img src="assets/images/first.png" alt="first interface" />

    <h3>steps :</h3>
    <p>give valid input</p>
    <img src="assets/images/cap2.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      when you select data the interface should looks like in the image below
      :
    </p>
    <img src="assets/images/cap3.png" alt="" />

    <p>
      click on a customer , his informations will show on the right of the
      interface
    </p>

    <h3>valid input :</h3>
    <h4>1. Size of population</h4>
    <p>
      The initial population is a group of potential solutions this solutions
      created based on heuristics algorithms like savings of clarke & wright
      and others , there is some randomness in the creations i used 2-opt and
      or-opt swap in random way ( random routes , points of swap up) to create
      diversity that give chance to get members with high fitness
    </p>
    <p>
      So big number of population give more diversity and chance to get best
      solutions but long time of execution .
      <span>
        <br />
        [200,400] is a good number of population.</span>
    </p>
    <h4>2. Crossover Ratio</h4>
    <p>It is the percentage of the population with the highest fitness that selected to be the parents in crossover to
      create new genes (or
      children )High percentage (ex: 90%) give the chance to members with bad fitness to meet members with
      high fitness and that give us bad child... <span> best ratio [70%,60%] </span></p>

    <h4>3. Mutation Rate</h4>
    <p>It is the possibility to every gene to change its place in DNA array , High rate it's totally randomness because
      each gene will change its place and that gives us a random genes and a child with bad fitness (just like in the
      real life lot of genetic mutations gives unhealthy child)then the final result will be the result of heuristic
      algorithms and we don't want that ,<span>best Mutation Rate [2.5 %, 1%]</span> </p>
    <h4>4. Number of Generations</h4>
    <p>big number of generations means high possibility to get optimal solution but long time of execution too .
      <span>[1000,2000] its a good number of generations</span></p>

    <h3> RESULTS :</h3>
    <P>final results should shows up like this: </P>
